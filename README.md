# QA-Portfolio
Completed a 6-week QA internship gaining hands-on experience in manual and automated testing, test case creation, bug reporting, performance testing with JMeter, security testing using OWASP ZAP, CI/CD concepts, GitHub usage, and building a complete professional QA portfolio.
During this 6-week Quality Assurance internship, I gained hands-on experience in both manual and automated software testing, along with a strong understanding of real-world QA workflows.

**Week 1** focused on QA fundamentals, including the role of Quality Assurance, differences between QA and QC, SDLC, STLC, and an overview of software testing concepts.
**Week 2** covered manual testing practices such as writing test cases, executing test scenarios, identifying defects, and creating professional bug reports with clear reproduction steps and severity levels.
**Week 3** introduced different types of testing, including functional, regression, smoke, sanity, compatibility, performance, and security testing, helping me understand when and why each type is used.
**Week 4** was focused on performance testing using tools like Apache JMeter, where I learned to simulate multiple users, analyze response times, and create performance test reports.
**Week 5** emphasized security testing concepts, including common web vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and XSS, and hands-on practice using OWASP ZAP for basic security assessment.
**Week 6** covered CI/CD concepts for QA, test automation integration, Git/GitHub usage, and the preparation of a complete QA portfolio, including test cases, bug reports, test plans, automation scripts, and documentation suitable for professional and real-world use.
