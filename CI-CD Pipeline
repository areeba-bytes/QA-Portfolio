Both Selenium and Cypress CI/CD pipelines automate test execution on code commits, running tests in headless browsers 
and generating comprehensive HTML reports with visual evidence (screenshots/videos) of test results. These pipelines 
support multiple triggers (commit, scheduled, manual, PR), provide instant feedback to development teams through automated 
notifications, and ensure continuous quality validation before code reaches production environments.
